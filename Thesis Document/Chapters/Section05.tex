This research focused on European Portuguese as the target language for model adaptation. Consequently, all evaluation methods were specifically designed to assess performance in European Portuguese. Previous research has explored various datasets relevant to Portuguese language processing \cite{rodrigues2020, santos2019, branco2021}, though it is noteworthy that the majority of existing benchmarks predominantly focus on Brazilian Portuguese rather than European Portuguese variants.


\section{Evaluation Methodology}
For comprehensive assessment of model performance in European Portuguese, two complementary benchmarks were employed: \textit{CalamePT} \cite{calamept_reference} and \textit{SuperGluePTPT} \cite{superglue_reference}. Both benchmarks contain peer-reviewed data specifically curated for the European variant of Portuguese, ensuring the validity of our evaluation in the target language context.

\subsection{CalamePT Benchmark}
The CalamePT benchmark evaluates a model's ability to perform contextually appropriate text completion. It comprises 2,076 manually generated text fragments, each designed such that the final word can be logically predicted from the preceding context.

A representative example from this benchmark is: "Ela correu durante horas para alcançar a linha de \textunderscore{chegada}" (She ran for hours to reach the finish line), where "chegada" (finish) is the target completion token.

The evaluation protocol is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The model receives the text with the final word omitted as input
    \item If the first token generated by the model matches the expected completion word, a positive score is assigned
    \item This process is repeated across all prompts in the dataset
    \item The final score represents the percentage of correctly completed prompts
\end{enumerate}

This methodology provides a direct assessment of the model's ability to understand and generate contextually appropriate Portuguese vocabulary.

\subsection{SuperGluePTPT Benchmark}
The SuperGluePTPT dataset was developed through a rigorous translation of the original English SuperGlue benchmark \cite{wang2019superglue} into European Portuguese. Following translation, approximately 85\% of the dataset underwent peer review by native European Portuguese speakers to ensure linguistic accuracy and cultural appropriateness.

This benchmark focuses on evaluating higher-level language understanding through a series of binary classification tasks. The evaluation methodology involves:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Presenting the model with questions that require yes/no responses
    \item Employing specific prompt engineering techniques to constrain model outputs to binary responses
    \item Calculating accuracy as the percentage of correct answers relative to the ground truth
\end{enumerate}

This approach provides insight into the model's capacity for complex reasoning and language understanding in Portuguese, beyond simple token prediction.

\section{Results Analysis}
\subsection{Comparative Performance}
The adapted model demonstrated significant improvements in Portuguese language processing capabilities compared to the baseline model. Table \ref{tab:benchmark_results} presents a comparative analysis of performance across both evaluation benchmarks.

Mean Vector Initialization & XX.X & XX.X & XX.X \\
Position-Weighted Initialization & XX.X & XX.X & XX.X \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Token Efficiency Analysis}
One of the key metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of our tokenizer adaptation is token efficiency—the average number of tokens required to encode equivalent text in Portuguese. Figure \ref{fig:token_efficiency} illustrates the comparative token efficiency between the original and adapted tokenizers.

The adapted tokenizer demonstrated a XX\% reduction in the number of tokens required to encode Portuguese text, which has significant implications for both computational efficiency and context window utilization.

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis}
Beyond quantitative metrics, qualitative analysis of model outputs revealed several noteworthy patterns:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The adapted model demonstrated improved handling of Portuguese-specific grammatical constructs, particularly with regard to gendered nouns and verb conjugations
    \item Idiomatic expressions unique to European Portuguese were more accurately processed by the adapted model
    \item The position-weighted initialization method showed particular strength in maintaining semantic coherence when generating longer text sequences
\end{itemize}

These observations suggest that the tokenizer adaptation approach not only improves benchmark performance but also enhances qualitative aspects of language generation that may not be fully captured by quantitative metrics alone.
